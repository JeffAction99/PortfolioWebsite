    <p>My name is Jeffrey. I am an experienced games developer that has graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London. This page includes some projects that I have done throughout my time at university.</p>
    <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
    <p>I finished my Games Programming couse at Goldsmiths, University of London. I pride myself at my passion for gaming and the games industry. In addition, I also have autism, but I consider it to be a superpower as I believe it makes my passion for games stronger. As well as games development, I also enjoy designing levels and areas as this can be shown in my different projects. On top of that, I experiment with different gameplay mechanics so I can try to make games that I would like to try and build. I am open to work at tech related jobs, including games development and software development. In addition, I am also looking into game jams that I would like to attend.</p>
